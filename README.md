File '12 Tutorial.Rmd' provides a detailed tutorial on the essential steps in using the framework. The code integrates DL breeding, development through egg, hopper and adult stages, feeding and swarm migration with remote-sensed data and weather-driven models for wind trajectories. Before running the tutorial, download 'Data.zip' from [https://doi.org/10.17863/CAM.111882](https://doi.org/10.17863/CAM.111882)  and unarchive file with data.
