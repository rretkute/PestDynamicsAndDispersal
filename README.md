# PestDynamicsAndDispersal
 Renata Retkute, William Thurston, Keith Cressman, Christopher A. Gilligan. A framework for modelling migratory pest population dynamics and large-scale dispersal. https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2023.07.11.548524v1

File '12 Tutorial.Rmd' provides a detailed tutorial on the essential steps in using the framework. The code integrates DL breeding, development through egg, hopper and adult stages, feeding and swarm migration with remote-sensed data and weather-driven models for wind trajectories. Before running the tutorial, dowload 'Data.zip' from   [TBA](https://www.repository.cam.ac.uk/handle/1810/373495)  and unarchive file with data.
